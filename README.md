# Hotel Management System

## Overview
The Hotel Management System is a Java-based application designed to automate room allocation and maintain customer records. The system provides a user-friendly and attractive interface for hotel staff to manage daily operations efficiently.

## Features
- **Automatic Room Allocation**: The system automatically assigns rooms to customers based on availability.
- **Customer Record Maintenance**: Keeps detailed records of customer information, including check-in/check-out dates, room assignments, and billing details.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is designed using Java Swing to ensure ease of use and an attractive presentation.

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows XP or higher (Windows 10 recommended)
- **Java Framework**: Java-supported framework required (Swing for the UI)
- **Database**: MySQL for back-end data management
- **Backup**: Regular database backup is recommended for data integrity and security.

### Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10
- **Front End**: Java (using Swing for the graphical user interface)
- **Back End**: MySQL

### Hardware Requirements
- Any machine compatible with running the necessary software and resources for the hotel management system.

## Development Environment
- **Java Version**: JDK 1.8 or higher
- **IDE**: Recommended to use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for development.
- **MySQL Version**: MySQL 5.7 or higher
- **Java APIs**: Swing API for GUI development

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. **Install Java JDK**:
   - Ensure Java JDK 1.8 or higher is installed on your system.
   - Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable if needed.
3. **Set Up MySQL Database**:
   - Install MySQL server.
   - Create a database named `hotel_management`.
   - Import the provided SQL file (`hotel_management.sql`) to set up the necessary tables and data.
4. **Run the Application**:
   - Compile and run the Java application using your preferred IDE or command line.

## Usage
- **User Interface**: The application opens with a login screen for hotel staff. After logging in, users can access various features such as room allocation, customer check-in/check-out, and report generation.
- **Database Backup**: Regular backups of the MySQL database are recommended to prevent data loss.

## Development Notes
- The project is built using the Java Swing API, which provides a modern and flexible UI compared to the older AWT components.
- All AWT components have been replaced with Swing components to ensure compatibility and improved functionality.
